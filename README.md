## About Me:
I am Pouya Aminaie. I am a graduate student at Politecnico di Milano, Italy. Currently, I am fully dedicated to my master's thesis as an intern at STMicroelectronics with the RFC Product Engineering team in Agrate, focusing on communication device development.


My research interests span the following areas: 
Yield Analysis in Semiconductor Manufacturing
RFIC Characterization
High-Frequency Circuit Design
Statistical Signal Processing

In addition to my technical expertise, I developed soft skills during the internship at ST. I gained valuable experience in a speak-up culture by learning the importance of equity, diversity, and inclusion, which bring more engagement and collaboration to me and my team members. I significantly enhanced my communication, presentation, and problem-solving skills, contributing to a more productive and cohesive work environment while strengthening my ability to foster collaboration and drive results.
